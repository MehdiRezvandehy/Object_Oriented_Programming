# Object_Oriented_Programming

Object oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions). OOP offers the potential to evolve programming to a higher level of abstraction.
It also provides flexibility for codebase through inheritance and polymorphism. This notebook presents fundamental of OOP in Python.


Python functions and data files to run this notebook are in my [Github](https://github.com/MehdiRezvandehy/Object_Oriented_Programming.git) page.
